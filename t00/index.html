<h2 id="anchor"> what makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p> Asuperhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the 
    ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. 
    So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more 
    exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, 
    and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. 
    Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered 
    a superhero. </p>
    <p>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy 
    could be just a regular police story or detective story
     or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a
      superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.
